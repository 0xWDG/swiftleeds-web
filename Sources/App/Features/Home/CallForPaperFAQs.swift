We also allow talks on design, architecture, working in software, indie development, testing, and more.",

Still, otherwise, we can and will do everything we can to cover travel up to £1,200 for international travellers, up to £500 for EU-based travellers and £200 for UK-based travellers."

            "We utilise a tool called <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sessionize</a> for evaluation of speakers. Our team of volunteers each get randomly served three anonymous talks at a time and must rank them. At this stage we do not see who the speaker is, but only the title and description you provide.",
            "This process is repeated 100s of times with many combinations of talks by each of our volunteers until a ranking is generated, at which point we find out who the speakers are.",
            "With this ranking we work from the top and remove any duplicate talks, and additional talks from the same speaker. We'll then reach out to the top speakers to confirm their attendance, simply working down the list until we have the right number to fill our spots.",

            "SwiftLeeds receives a lot of talk submissions and we're constantly balancing the types of talks to ensure the best experience for everybody.",
            "You might find it beneficial to ask a friend to review your proposal. We only see the title and description when reviewing, so it's important to give us all the facts and demonstrate why your talk would be perfect this year."

            "As you can imagine, reviewing over 150 proposals is incredibly time-consuming, and we make sure that everyone is given a fair evaluation so that this process can take time.",
            "However, after CfP closes (at the end of April), it's our mission to start the evaluation, and we'll usually begin letting speakers know in May & June.",
            "This is based on how long it takes us, so if you've not heard anything, let us know, and we'll update you on where we are in the process."
