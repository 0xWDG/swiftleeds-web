## Introduction 👋🏼

SwiftLeeds is a brand new Swift conference that started in 2021. It's a truly unique conference that is built by the community for the community. Hosted in the heart of Leeds City, UK.

The website is split into two components: the API and the front-end. Our immediate focus is developing a solid API that can power multiple platforms. Over the next few weeks, we'll be adding more and more front-end content to complement our API efforts.

## Last Stable Release 🚀

## Developer Setup 💻

Follow these steps to get your development environment setup to run SwiftLeeds locally.

### Prerequisites
SwiftLeedsWeb runs off Vapor (of course!), which requires a couple of pre-requisites: 
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* [Vapor](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/install/macos/)

Once you have those two dependencies installed, you're ready to get started. For now, we'll ignore running in a production like environment. Instead, we'll focus on local only build. See the advanced setup below to get started with Docker. 

To start, open the `Package.swift` file. It'll take a few moments for the dependencies to download, especially on first open. Once done, hit the play button. That's it! You're ready to rock and roll. You should now see http://127.0.0.1:8080 up and running.
